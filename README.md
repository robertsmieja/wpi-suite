## What is WPI Suite?

WPI Suite is a set of software tools that assist developers with project management tasks. Currently this includes defect tracking. It is a modular application designed to support easy module creation and extension. The client application is built using Java Swing and the server is implemented using Java Servlets. The client and server communicate via a public REST API exposed by the server.
